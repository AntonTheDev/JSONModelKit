## Example - Collection Types
JSONModelKit's support for mapping Dictionaries and Arrays when parsing a responses' collection values is quite easy. Let's assume in the example below that the business listing result returns an array of ratings, and we would like to store them as an Array<Int> type

**Response Dictionary**

```
{
    "business_uuid"		: 9223123456754776000,
    "business_name"		: "UsTwoRestaurant",
    "business_ratings"	: [ 5, 4, 5, 4 ],
    "business_location" : {
        "longitude" : 40.7053319,
        "latitude"  : -74.0129945
    },
    "business_open"		: 1
}
```
First, update a model mapping for the Business object by defining setting the **type** key definition to `Array`, and adding a new **collection_subtype** key to define the subtype as `Int`.


```
Input File: JSOModelKit/Mappings/Business.json

{
    "uuid" : { ... },
    "businessName" : { ... },
    "ratings" : {
        "key" : "ratings",
        "type" : "Array",
        "subtype" : "Double"
    },
    "metaTags" : { ... },
    "open" : { ... }
}
```

When parsing the data for a `Business` object, JSONModelKit will create a parsed ratings `Array<Double>`, and will assign the resulting value to the ratings property of the `Business` instance before returning it.

This also works for Dictionaries by setting the **type** key to Dictionary. When parsing a dictionary, JSONModelKit will use the assigned keys in the response when setting the values in the parsed `Dictionary`. If the response is an array, and the property to be mapped is a dictionary, JSONModelKit will use an incremental index as the key starting with zero.

Note: When parsing collections, **collection_subtype** can be any of the native value types `String`, `Int`, `Double`, `Float`, `Bool`, and/or any object generated by a JSONModelKit.
